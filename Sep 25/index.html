Benifits of using callback:

        1. Asynchronous Programming: allow JavaScript to handle asyrrhromus tasks effciently. While waiting for an operation (like a server response), the program can continue executing other code.

        2. Reusability: You can pass different callback functions to the same function, allowing the code to be more flexible and reusable.

        3. Control Over Execution Order: Callback help control when a certain piece of code should run, especially in asynchronous scenarios.


Write a JS to add two numbers first and then check if the sum is even or odd using callback function.

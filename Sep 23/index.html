<!-- 
 
In JS a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is excecuted after some operation has been completed. Callbacks are a way to ensure that code is excecuted only after a task has been completed.
This is specially useful in asynchronous operations like file reading, API requests or timeouts.

Key points:
        1. Passing function as arguments- In JS functions are treated as first class citizens, meaning they can be passed around like any other value(like strings, numbers etc).
        2. Excecuting the callback- A callback is called withing the parent function after some operation or event with highest priority has been excecuted.
